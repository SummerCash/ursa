## Credits

Big thanks to the [Perlin-network](https://github.com/perlin-network) team for writing a large portion of the necessary [preliminary foundation logic](https://github.com/perlin-network/life) of the VM! This repository is mainly just for cleaning up a bit of their work and adding on certain features that may be useful in the future.
