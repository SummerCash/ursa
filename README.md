A stack-based Go WebAssembly virtual machine.

## Credits

A big thanks to the [Perlin-network](https://github.com/perlin-network) team for writing a large portion of the necessary preliminary foundation logic of the VM! This repository is mainly just for cleaning up a bit of their work and adding certain features that may be useful in the future.
